# Multi-Word CAS

In this task, you need to implement the atomic `cas2(..)` for `AtomicArray`, 
which atomically changes two locations in the array. Please use the multi-word
CAS algorithm discussed in class. Remember to always install k-CAS descriptors 
in the same order. 


To test your solution, please run:

* `./gradlew build` on Linux or MacOS
* `gradlew build` on Windows
